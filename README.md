# Class Profile Web

=========================

## About

The Software Engineering Class Profile is a student-initiative focused on showcasing what the program was
like for students. It covers content covering co-op, background, academics, lifestyle, future plans, and
answers questions such as "How frequently did students exercise?" or "How much debt do students graduate with?".

You can view the class profile at [https://sexxis.github.io/classprofile](https://sexxis.github.io/classprofile).

## Setup

**You need a Ruby version at least < 3.0 (2.7.0 works)!**

Run `yarn install`. You'll also need `jekyll` to run a local host. Run `gem install jekyll` if you don't have it.

## Running Locally

- `npm run prod` (build the TypeScript Code) will update the `min.js` file in the `build` directory.
- `bundle exec jekyll serve` run the jekyll server

### for "reloadable" local testing

1. change [`main.html:51`](./_layouts/main.html)'s script src to point to `./build/bundle.js`
2. run `npm run dev` in a console to watch for changes and build to `./build/bundle.js`
3. in another console, run `bundle exec jekyll serve` to run the jekyll server (site usually defaults to some localhost)
4. refresh the tab directed to the lcoalhost site to get the updated site

| :exclamation: Don't check `main.html` in without switching to the minified bundle source! |

## Adding a section

- create the appropriate `<topic name>.html` file in the [`./content`](./content) folder
  - for each graph, add a div with a unique id
- add a `render<topic name>` function in [`main.ts`](main.ts)
  - the logic to generate the graphs should be included in this function
- include the `<topic name>.html` file in [`index.html`](./index.html) in the right section
- link the section in [`introduction.html`](./content/introduction.html), Sections
