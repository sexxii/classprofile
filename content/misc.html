<h3> Beauty in the details </h3>
<p class="full">
  Reflecting on our time at Waterloo means more than making some graphs. Here are
  some stories over the past 5 years.

    <span class="big path-title">Biking Buddies</span>
    <p>
      "In my second [co-op] term, I snuck into Google's headquarters in Palo Alto with
      my good friend [redacted] on a weekend, and no one was around so we stole their
      campus bikes and went sightseeing around the area. My phone's camera had broken
      autofocus so we couldn't get nice pictures, which is the sad part. We were good
      boys so we returned the bikes. Finally, in an attempt to catch the free Palo Alto shuttle, we ran for a good
      few kilometres.

      <br /><br />

      [This] stands out as one of my favourite days in SE since it was the
      day I learned about [redacted]'s interest in entrepreneurship, which also made
      me more optimistic about it, which has now led into us building out our FYDP
      venture."

    <p>
      "The closest friends I made, I made them in the Software Lounge. I don't know
      if its the room or the people who also thought the lounge was a great place to
      hangout, but I had so many fond memories there. I worked there all the time
      and sometimes cried there too, played a lot of games, goofed around, slept on
      the couch (which is definitely a must) but also that's where I got to meet my
      FYDP team. Find a Software Lounge in your life and oh my your University Degree
      is gonna fly by."

      "I got drunk at a work party on[e] time in San Francisco on a work term. I don't
      remember anything that happened that night but I woke up in a hospital with
      vomit on my jeans, and was told I was found on the side of some street.
      <br /><br />
      Hospital and ambulance bills ended up costing me over $6000 USD, and my
      travel insurance didn't cover it because it was a 'self-inflicted injury'.
      Thankfully I had work insurance and only ended up paying $2000. I went in
      to work the next day.
