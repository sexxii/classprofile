    Most respondents went home at least once a term in both first year and
    fourth year.

  Before the pandemic, most of us lived near campus and away from family.
  <br /><br />
  From first year to fourth year we saw an increase in the number of people who
  lived at home. Perhaps that was due to online classes or difficulties finding
  housing.
