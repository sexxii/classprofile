  </span>
  There are many on-campus communities that support the success of women in
  Computer Science and Engineering at UWaterloo. For example,
  <a href="https://sesoc.uwaterloo.ca/wise">Women in Software (WiSE)</a>,
  <a href="http://wics.uwaterloo.ca/">Women in Computer Science (WiCS)</a>,
  <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/women-in-engineering/">Women in Engineering (WiE)</a>, and

    More than half of respondents come from families whose income is higher than
    the median Canadian family income (<a
      href="https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/t1/tbl1/en/tv.action?pid=1110001201">$96,080</a>).
  </span>

<h3> Level of education </h3>
<p class="half">
  <span class="big">
    There are more parents with Master's and Doctorates combined than those with Bachelors.
  </span>
  Compared to our parents, only 3 respondents are planning on attending
  grad school. This could
  be a generational shift, or could be because entering the software industry does not require
  a Master's or Doctorate.

  <p class="full">
    <span class="big">
      The majority of students have at least 1 sibling.
    </span>
    There is also no clear correlation between familial income and number of siblings. The median for 0 and 2+ siblings
    is in the 100k to 150k income per year bracket and the median for 1 sibling is in the 150k to 200k income per year
    bracket.

<h2> High School, Enriched Programs & CEGEP </h2>

<h3>Admission Average</h3>

<h3>Enriched Programs</h3>
<p class="half">
  <span class="big">
    Just over half of the respondents did not take part in an Enriched Program.
  </span>
  The most popular Enriched Programs among respondents were
  AP and IB.

  <h3>CEGEP</h3>
  <p class="half">
    <span class="big">
      All students from Quebec attended CEGEP partially, meaning they did not graduate.

    Among respondents, no students from outside of Quebec attended CEGEP.

  <h3>CEGEP Fields</h3>
  <p class="half">
    <span class="big">
      The students who attended CEGEP took part in a wide variety of programs related to Science,
      Mathematics, and Computer Science.
    </span>
    Unlike other universities, CEGEP students enrolled in an Engineering program at Waterloo cannot convert
    any of their CEGEP course credits into university credits. An exception exists for Calculus courses which can be
    counted as
    a credit toward Math 117 (Calculus 1 for Engineering) in some cases. <a

<h2> Others </h2>

<h3>Programming Knowledge</h3>
<p class="half">
  <span class="big">
    5.6% of respondents did not know how to program prior to starting at UWaterloo.
  </span>
  Programming knowledge is a required admission criterion to join the Software Engineering
  program at the University of Waterloo.
  The non-zero amount of students who had no prior coding experience could be due to transfer
  student responses, among other reasons.
