<h3> Reason for Switching </h3>
<p class="half">
    <span class="big">
        A flexible course schedule and avoiding a specific course were the main reasons for switching out of
        Software Engineering.
    </span>
    The Engineering program has a relatively rigid course schedule which offers students the flexibility to choose
    courses usually only in their fourth year.
    The Computer Science program, on the other hand, is less restrictive and allows students to customize their
    schedules freely.
    Surprisingly, no respondents chose Exchange or Graduating Early as the most important reson for switch out.

<h3>I Regret Nothing</h3>

    <span class="big">
        All of the transferred students were happy with their decision to switch.
    </span>
    The Computer Science program was successfully able to provide the transferred students with a better place to align
    themselves with their university goals.
