<h3> Reason for Switching </h3>
<p class="half">
<span class="big">
    A flexible course schedule is the main reason for switching out of Software Engineering.
</span>
The Engineering program has a relatively rigid course schedule which offers students the flexibility to choose courses usually only in their fourth year. 
The Computer Science program, on the other hand, is less restrictive and allows students to customize their schedules freely. 
<br /> <br />
Other reasons for transferring included avoiding a course, graduating early, and accommodating for an exchange term.
