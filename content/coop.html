<h1 id="coop">Co-op</h1>
<h3>Companies</h3>
<p class="full">
  <span class="big"> At least 166 companies have hired an SE student. </span>
  Students had the opportunity to work in many different types of environments,
  including lean startups, writing code in Japan, researching with professors,
  and working at large tech companies. While a majority of students were
  software engineers during their co-ops, some explored other areas such as game
  development, product management, and trading.
  <br />
  <br />
  The benefit of having 6 co-op terms is that students get to explore different
  company sizes doing different positions in different cities. This is
  invaluable for students because it helps students figure out what they want
  upon graduation.

    Co-ops happend all across North America, and a few across the world!
  </span>
  The majority that co-oped in the US worked in California or on the east coast.
  <br />
  <br />
  Even though the University of Waterloo did not authorize any co-ops outside of
  Canada once the pandemic hit, many respondents said they worked in the US for
  their last few co-ops. This might have been possible due to the University
  lowering the number of required (authorized) co-ops.

  <h3>Favourite Locations</h3>
  <p class="half">
    <span class="big">
      30% of respondents picked California as their favourite work location, and
      41% of respondents' favourite work location was in the US. Toronto was a
      close favourite with 24% of respondents picking it as their top choice.
    </span>
    The pandemic likely hindered students from exploring opportunities outside
    of Canada as the percent of US locations dropped from 68% in 2021 to 41% in
    2022. On the flip side, it is also surprising that California has dropped
    from 39.6% in 2021 to 30% in 2022, which suggests it may not be the right
    place for everyone, especially with the infamous cali or bust mentality.

<h3>Salary</h3>
<p class="half">
  <span class="big">
    Median hourly compensation increased over time. By the last co-op term,
    compensation had on average increased by 2.8x compared to the first co-op
    term.
  </span>
  Average hourly compensation per co-op term was
  <b>$19.86, $30.14, $38.18, $42.21, $46.37, $51.55</b> (in CAD). <br /><br />
  The difference could be explained by the exchange rate between the USD and the
  CAD, as more respondents started working in the US, and an increase in
  salaries and stipends to compensate for the difference in living costs between
  different locations. As a very loose example, renting in San Francisco
  typically costs between $2,000 to $2,500 per month. In comparison, Waterloo
  housing costs approximately $800 per month.
  <br /><br />
  Note that these values do not include additional compensation such as housing
  stipends.

<h3>Co-op Applications Breakdown</h3>
<p class="full">
  <span class="big">
    As respondents gained work experience, they applied to fewer jobs over time,
    found more jobs outside of WaterlooWorks and returned to previous employers
    more frequently.

  Respondents applied to 3 times fewer jobs by their last co-op.

<h3>Co-op Ratings</h3>

  Across every co-op term, at least 44% of respondents received an outstanding
  co-op rating and 91% received an excellent co-op rating or higher. During the
  4th and 5th co-op terms, 60% and 59% of respondents received an outstanding.

      switch so I found them after I had given up looking and was just going to
      leave). Finally got there about 30 seconds after they had called me to the
      interview, but it felt like I was going to be 10 minutes late. (also it

    up taking (it was supposed to be in a house full of booby traps and
    whatnot), but our arsonistic nature forced the final boss and his henchmen
    to abandon their base and fight us out in the open"

<h2>Does X affect job pay?</h2>
<h3>Salary as a metric</h3>
<p class="full">
  In order to rank jobs appropriately, salary is used as a proxy metric to
  measure job opportunities. Due to the limited expressiveness of this metric,
  the following results should be taken with a grain of salt because higher
  salary does not imply higher job satisfaction.
</p>

<div class="vbx2"></div>
<h3>Grades</h3>
<p class="half">
  <span class="big">
    There is no clear correlation between grades and salary.
  </span>
  In other words, having a high cumulative average does not imply that the
  student will get a good salary in the upcoming co-op term. This suggests that
  there are more important factors than grades when it comes to finding a good
  job.
  <br /><br />
  Some companies do use grades as a cutoff to filter large candidate pools.
  However, many companies are aware that grades are not a good indication of how
  performant a student can be during co-op.
  <br /><br />
  This suggests that if a student wanted to optimize for getting the best co-op
  possible, aiming for a higher grade may not yield the desired results, and
  their efforts could be redirected towards other involvements such as side
  projects.

<h3>Gender</h3>
<p class="half">
  <span class="big">
    Women are paid less than men on average for co-op terms.
  </span>

  Although the data trends from our survey indicate that women are paid less
  than men, it is difficult to determine which portion of the compensation
  difference is due solely to gender bias, as opposed to other causes. The other
  variables include a difference in interests (in terms of work location, type
  of work, etc.) among men and women respondents in the class.
  <br />
  Note: There were about 30-42 men and 8-9 women who responded to co-op
  salaries.
  <br /><br />

  However, this does not suggest that there is no gender bias in the long term.
  In fact, according to
  <a
    target="_blank"
    href="https://research-content.glassdoor.com/app/uploads/sites/2/2016/03/Glassdoor-Gender-Pay-Gap-Study.pdf"
    >a Glassdoor study</a
  >, "younger workers face a smaller gender pay gap than older workers." This
  finding is not exclusive to the tech industry.

  Based on the co-op average in first year, it is unlikely that admission
